# Fruit Maturity Detection Using Deep Learning :


## Project Overview 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the maturity (fresh or rotten) of fruits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of fruit images and leverages data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and performance.


## Key Features
### Convolutional Neural Networks : 
Utilizes pre-trained CNN architectures (Inception V3 and VGG16) for efficient feature extraction and classification.
### Data Augmentation : 
Employs techniques like random cropping, flipping, and rotation to increase dataset size and prevent overfitting.
### Model Fine-tuning : 
Adapts pre-trained models to the specific task of fruit maturity detection.
### Performance Evaluation : 
Evaluates model accuracy on unseen test data.


## Results 
### Inception V3 : 
Achieved 95.0% accuracy.
### VGG16 : 
Achieved 91.6% accuracy.


## Dataset :
Using dataset Fruits fresh and rotten for classification (dataset contains 13599 images of apple, banana, and orange divided into fresh and rotten each) taken from Kaggle.
